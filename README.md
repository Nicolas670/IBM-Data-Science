# IBM-Data-Science
In this repository you will find some projects I did for the IBM Advaned Data Science Course (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm?).  
And mainly the captsone project in which I took a shot at the Kaggle covid19 challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).  
The main task of this project was Natural Language Processing and Topic Modelling in specific.  
The result hence is an interactive topic map of all the articles provided on Kaggle.
